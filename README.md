This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and use [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) API for current weather data.
Application is code for learning purpose and it is inspired to the [Tyler Potts](https://github.com/TylerPottsDev/weather-react), video tutorial: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuA0_Z1llYU&t=1195s)


## Configuration

Before run or build the application edit `src\settings.js` putting your OpenWeatherMap API KEY.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
